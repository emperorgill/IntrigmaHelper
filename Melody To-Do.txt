Please do the following...

1.  In request_module.py, RECOGNIZED_REQUEST_TYPES is a hard-coded list.
Please replace this list with an empty list.  Then, whenever is_a_request
is called, check to see if the list is empty.  If it is empty, have the 
computer read this list in from the file Request Types.txt in Config Files.  
That way, hopefully, we do the disk operation only once rather than every
time we have to call is_a_request.  You can refer to shift_module.py for
an example of how to do this.
((DONE))

2.  Please complete AACC_dates.py which will need to call upon Config Files/
AACC Dates.txt.  This is the first of our user-facing functions so we might
need to come back to this one later on when we get a better sense of how our
user-facing functions need to work.  In brief, however, the functions in
AACC_dates.py will be called by cli.py (which is not yet created) which will
pass appropriate parameters.  AACC_dates.py will then pass a text string back
and cli.py will probably just print it directly to the screen so the text
needs to be nicely formatted for users, including any error messages.  If
cli.py is ever replaced by gui.py, gui.py will probably take that text
response and stick it into a message box for the user to read.

3.  Create a program that puts out statistics for a given schedule.
