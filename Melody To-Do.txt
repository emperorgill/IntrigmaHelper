Please do the following...

1.  In request_module.py, RECOGNIZED_REQUEST_TYPES is a hard-coded list.
Please replace this list with an empty list.  Then, whenever is_a_request
is called, check to see if the list is empty.  If it is empty, have the 
computer read this list in from the file Request Types.txt in Config Files.  
That way, hopefully, we do the disk operation only once rather than every
time we have to call is_a_request.  You can refer to shift_module.py for
an example of how to do this.

2.  Create program to tell us when various AACC shifts fall on the calendar.

3.  Create a program that puts out statistics for a given schedule.
